            <h3>First Impressions Can Make Or Break You</h3>

            <p>Your website is often the first impression you have on people. You want your visitor impressed the second they see your landing page. Those first few seconds could determine whether the visitors stays on the page, visits other pages, and buys in. If it isn’t branded in an attractive way or its user experience is confusing, your users won’t take the time to learn about your product (even if it fits their solution).</p>

            <h3>Factors</h3>

            <p>Your website's load time, colors, logo, layout, popups and ease of navigation can all play a factor in your visitor's first impression of your website. Even the slightest imperfections can add up and cause a significant amount of your visitors to leave. On average, visitors spend fewer than 15 seconds on a website, this means you have a finite amount of time to impress your visitors. A bad first impression can keep them from returning to your site and take its toll on your bounce rate.</p>

            <p>To make a great impression on your visitors you need have great appearance and usability. Users want to interact with your website and explore it. Your website should provide direction and be easy for a visitor to navigate. The color, size, placement, and imagery can affect the experience of your visitors, so make sure you utilize them in a cohesive manner to highlight the proper visual weight for each section.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>

            <p>Users aren’t looking to be bothered with fluffed up content and inconsistant imagery, they want to find out what your company does quickly and easily. If they find your website meets their expectations, they will continue returning to your website to seek further information when they desire it.</p>

            <p>It’s these people who will become promoters of your brand, commenters on articles, and possible customers. As long as you manage to create an ideal first impression your target audience is pleased with, you will start to build a successful website, following, and community.</p>
